I tried to keep the output, concept and hierarchy as near as possible to our descripcion and example. 

I had one problem with the System.countInMilis(); method.
I was able to witness a inconsitent amout of decimals every 5 or 6 time when i run the programm. So i dont konow if my ide is again making some weird stuff or if it is possible for the method to return numbers with one decimals less.
I thought it was negligible.
